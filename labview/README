The LabVIEW port consists of wrapper functions around freesteam's high-level
functionality since representing the SteamState struct in LabVIEW proved to be
rather nightmarish.  Importing the fsteam.dll into LabVIEW results in easy
property lookups.

The fsteam.dll shared library can be compiled from source (fsteam.c & fsteam.h)
with:

$gcc -Wall -shared fsteam.c /path/to/freesteam.dll -I/path/containing/steam.h -o
fsteam.dll

The LabVIEW library file (fsteam.lvlib) and VIs (*.vi) have also been included
for quickstart applications.  The files are compatible with LabVIEW versions 8.0
and newer.  Copying the fsteam folder containing the LabVIEW files into the
C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW\user.lib\ folder will create a
subpalette on LabVIEW's functions palette.
