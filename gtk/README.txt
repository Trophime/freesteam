The attached is a very preliminary version of a GTK GUI written by Carlo
Tegano. It is still in very early prototype stage and has not yet been
thoroughly tested or checked.

To build it, call 'scons gtk' from the freesteam working directory. The 
build process has been tested on Ubuntu 9.10 but not Windows or Mac at this
stage.
